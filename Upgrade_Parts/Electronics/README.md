# Electronics Upgrades 
The original controller board is replaced with a Duet3 mini in order to run reprap firmware on it. By chance the mounting screws of the CB+ mostly fit the mounting holes of the Duet Mini, so the screws on the right of the board are directly using the original mounting points. The ones on the left (where the USB connector used to be) requires two adapters that can be found in "Upgrade_Parts/Electronics" see image below:

## WIFI Antenna
The USB port of the original controller board is repurposed to mount an external wifi antenna.

## Filament Sensor
A simple filament sensor that only detect the presence of filament is added on the bach sice of the printer. The folded part of the spool holder is used to hide the wire so it cant get entagled in the spool:
