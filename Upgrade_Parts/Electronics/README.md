The original controller board is replaced with a Duet3 mini in order to run reprap firmware on it. By chance the mounting screws of the CB+ mostly fit the mounting holes of the Duet Mini, so the screws on the right of the board are directly using the original mounting points. The ones on the left (where the USB connector used to be) requires two adapters that can be found in "Upgrade_Parts/Electronics" see image below:
