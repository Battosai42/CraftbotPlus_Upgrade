# CAD 
The following design tool are used used for all parts in this folder:

- All mechanical parts are designed in FreeCad v0.19
- All PCB's are designed in KiCad v6.0

## Printed Parts
PLA is prticularily unsuited for this application as it kreeps under stress and will become soft in the ambient temperature in the enclosure. I recommend printing the parts in ABS or another polymer with a high glass transition point as they will be operated at elevated temperatures of 50+ Â°C when the enclosure hood is used which makes the printer better suited to print more advanced filaments such as ABS or Nylon. 

Slicer Settings:
- 4 perimeters @0.4mm (1.6mm)
- 8 top/bottom layers @0.2mm (1.6mm)
- 40% infill
