## Bed Sensor (IR Probe)
As a bed sensor an [IR Probe](https://docs.duet3d.com/Duet3D_hardware/Accessories/IR_Probe) is used. While this is not the most versatile sensor as its realiability is heavily dependant on the bed surface, it is one of the most compact sensors and fits well between the mounting screws of the hotend cooling fan (see image below). A simple bracket is used that is sandwitchet between the fan and the metal bracket of the hotend.
