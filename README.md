# WORK IN PROGRESS!
This project is still being worked on and designs are prone to change

# Craftbot Plus Modification Purpose
The first variant of the Craftbot Plus (The one still using the drag chains) is a well built CoreXY 3D Printer, but it can no longer be considered a modern printer as it is lacking a lot of modern features and modifications are are not easy to do considering that it uses a proprietary and closed source controller board and firmware. Since this variant is using drag chains over the FFC cables, wiring to the Extruder is relatively simple to modify which opens up the possibility to modernise the printer with a modern and open controller board and firmware an add improvements to the printer as well as adding conveniance features.

# Intended Upgrades
The goal of the modifications is a high quality print (not a super fast one) and making the printer easier and more convenient to use. The following requirements list the intended upgrades and the state of implementation:

## Hardware
- [X] Duet Controller Board with external WiFi Antenna (Duet3 Mini 5+)
- [X] Filament Runout Sensor
- [X] Bed Probe (Duet3D IR Probe)
- [ ] Toolhead PCB (for easier modifications and chamber temperature sensor)
- [ ] Accelerometer (LIS3DSH)

## Software
- [X] Reprap Firmware (v 3.3)
- [X] Pressure Advance
- [X] Mesh bed compensation
- [ ] Input Shaping

## General
- [ ] Open Source wherever possible

# Instructions
TBD..

- [ ] Electronics Bay Modifications
- [ ] Duet Wiring
- [ ] Extruder
- [ ] Enclosure
